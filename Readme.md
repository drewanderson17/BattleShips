## Testing
**For more info look at the  test files in /FrontEndMain**

Frontend Testing
In order to test the frontend, we played our game! We would each launch our app on our separate laptops and visit the different pages while specifically looking for bugs. 
We found this was the most effective way to test the frontend as bugs in the backend 
and frontend can become extremely apparent while looking at the app from a user's perspective rather than only looking at the source code. 


The main testing done was to the grid.cpp and Ship.cpp class. Integration testing was done when a developer pushed their code into main
